<p></p>

VICasm is an assembler designed for the VICERA CPU. It has basic assembler
features such as labels, constant definition, `org` and multiple files support
such as other assembly files or binary files.

**NOTE** The assembler is not documented yet and the official VICERA
documentation needs to be redone.

## Building

To build the assembler, it's really simple. Just type `make`. You will probably
get a few warnings while building.

```
$ make
... A few warnings ...
$ ./vicasm
```
