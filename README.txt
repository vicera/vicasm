VICasm is an assembler specially designed for the VICERA CPU. It features
constant definition, multiple file assembly and labelling.

You may have seen a previous version of VICasm in C before, but because parsing
strings in C is hell, I decided to write it in C++.

You may know more about it later when it will reach a point of usability.
